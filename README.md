# Pixel Draw: A Simple JS App

### Description

- This was my first javascript project and it can be seen at https://beta-centauri.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- Introduction to helper functions.
- Calling one function from another function.

### What I am Proud Of:

- Figured out how to make a little click and drag feature for populating the pixels

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I wound are more options, like the ability to change the size of the grid.
